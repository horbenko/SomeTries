My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

**Create and host your own website using GitHub**

This is a test project that was created according to the tasks of the second selection stage of the [Binary Studio Academy](https://binary-studio.com/academy/) for the **.NET** course.

This project does not require any installation. It is only a part of the sequence task flow. So it does not include any complex sections, guide for setting, guidelines and so on...
